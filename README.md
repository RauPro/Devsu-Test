# BancoPichincha

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.
Feature Module Architecture
This project is based on the feature module architecture, which is a modular architecture that allows you to divide the application into modules, each of which is responsible for a specific feature. This architecture is based on the SOLID principles, which are:

Single Responsibility Principle
Open-Closed Principle
Liskov Substitution Principle
Interface Segregation Principle
Dependency Inversion Principle
The feature module architecture is based on the following principles:

Each module is responsible for a specific feature.
Each module is independent of the other modules.
Each module can be reused in other applications.
Each module can be tested independently.
Each module can be developed independently.
Each module can be deployed independently.
Each module can be maintained independently.
Each module can be scaled independently.
Each module can be documented independently.
Each module can be reused in other applications.
Each module can be tested independently.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
